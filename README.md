# StoryBit - TVMaze Streaming Dashboard (Full)

A modern streaming-style web application built using Next.js 14, TailwindCSS 3, and the TVMaze public API.

StoryBit Streaming is a fully responsive, Netflix-like UI that displays TV show listings, trending categories, detailed show pages, and banner highlights. The project demonstrates real-world frontend engineering skills including dynamic routing, external API integrations, client-side data management, and modern UI design patterns.

## Project Overview

StoryBit Streaming is a streaming dashboard inspired by platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, and Hotstar. It fetches TV show data from the TVMaze API, organizes it into categories (Trending, Popular, More To Watch), and displays them with a clean, animated, card-based layout.

The application includes:

  - A large hero banner showing the top show

  - Horizontally scrollable movie rows

  - Fully responsive design
