# StoryBit - TVMaze Streaming Dashboard (Full)

This is a full scaffold of a streaming-style dashboard using **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, integrated with **TVMaze** (no API key required).

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server
```bash
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

3. Build for production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Notes
- TVMaze requires no API key. All data is fetched client/server-side from `https://api.tvmaze.com`.
- Images come from `static.tvmaze.com`, configured in `next.config.ts`.
- If you deploy to Vercel, no environment variables are required.
